# WikiCraft

Welcome to WikiCraft, your new favorite crafting game helper. This project was inspired from the minds of WikiDev, a team of like minded web developers and avid gamers made up of Liz Rz, Nelson Drozd, Alex Bellamy, Graham Johnson, and Kerri Sosinski

## A little about our project

In this application you will find a place to store all of your building and crafting recipies for multiple games instead of having to search multiple Wiki sites. You can consolidate your crafting recipes by game and keep track of items you already have and what you still need for a particular item.

### `Our Motivation`

The motivation behind WikiCraft came from the need to conslidate gaming information into one site. As gamers we tend to get lost in a game for hours and who wants to search through sites for the recipes or build you need when you can go directly to your own library? You can find everything you are woking on or currently searching for. WikiCraft solves the problem of taking excessive time away from your gaming.

### `What we learned`

We learned react from end styling, working with the cloud database, working collectivly with deligating task and resposibilities as well as working together to solve problems or even just to cheer on a team meber as they solved an issue.

### `How our project stands out`

Our front end styling is stunning and the data base complexity can be configured for multiple other applicational uses.
